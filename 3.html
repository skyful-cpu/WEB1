    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss" target="blank">JavaScript often abbreviated JS</a>, is
        a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the
        World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript
        on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party
        libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
        execute the code on users' devices.

        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
        multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
        for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).
