    <h2>What is WEB?</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss" target="blank">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly
        known as the Web, is the world's dominant software platform. It is an
        information space where documents and other web resources can be accessed
        using a web browser and (more recently) web-based applications. The Web has
        changed people's lives immeasurably. It is the primary tool billions of people
        use to interact on the Internet.

        Web resources may be any type of downloadable media. Web pages are documents
        interconnected by hypertext links formatted in Hypertext Markup Language
        (HTML). The HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs, which permits
        users to navigate to other web resources. In addition to text, web pages may
        contain references to images, video, audio, and software components, which
        are either displayed or internally executed in the user's web browser to
        render pages or streams of multimedia content.
